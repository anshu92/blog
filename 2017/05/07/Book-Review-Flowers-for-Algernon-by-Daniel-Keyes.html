<p>I had stopped reading fiction for a while, but I came across this book and the setup intrigued me. I saw a rat in my building a few days ago and it freaked me out, and that&#8217;s why I guess the cover attracted my attention.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>I bought the audiobook and started listening to it on the way to work. My commute is 20 minutes, and the book is such a gripping tale that I wished it was longer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I strangely, or maybe not strangely empathize a lot with Charlie Gordon, the 32 year old protagonist of this book. He is a mentally challenged boy working in a bakery. He has been picked to be part of an experiment at the local college and he writes progress reports chronicling his understanding of what is being done to him. What hits you about the way the author narrates the book is the first thing you notice about the book. The voice and language matches Charlie&#8217;s as he progresses or digresses throughout.
Charlie is a good natured simpleton would be the way to put it. Or rather he is that kind, sensitive ten year old kid who has been mentally stationary as the rest of him grows older.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The story moves as Charlie starts responding to treatment and starts becoming smarter by the day. It exposes a lot of falsehoods, beliefs and opinions we treat as absolute when we interact we people we consider normal. It reveals the insignificance of the human ego, the neglect of the gifts we are bestowed by being born as a living creature with this configuration or programming. It also reveals the problems with the importance we place on non-existential things like superiority, pride and titular accomplishments.It reveals the great need of connecting with another through the emotion and bonding of love.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The inflection point occurs when Charlie seems to surpass his 'creators' in terms of intelligence and finds himself having only one other person who understands his situation - Algernon, the mouse who has undergone the same treatment as him. He realizes that brain power is not a substitute for emotional growth, and that whether a result of tribalism borne out of evolutionary necessity, or an inevitable accident of co-existence, human interaction is irrational and perhaps too multi-variate. The characters around him feel like a cast of a play - the kind, conflicted heroine played by Alice Kinnian, who was Charlie&#8217;s teacher and was perhaps the first to see Charlie as a human rather than a guinea pig, or a mouse. Faye, the carefree, artiste neighbor in contrast wanted life free of structure and pay heed to only primal urges. Dr.Strauss, with whom Charlie has therapy session - supportive, humane and predictable. Dr. Nemur, the guy in charge of the experiment - consumate academic, sees Charlie with the same eyes as he sees Algernon. Charlie&#8217;s family - they play a melodramatic side of Charlie&#8217;s flashbacks that help illustrate the difficulties of dealing with issues of people with various intelligence living together. Their repentance and joy when Charlie meets them during the intelligent phase is to me the place where the book tries to overplay its hand.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The book decides to become a tragedy as Charlie discovers that the permanence of his intelligence predicted by Dr.Nemur is infact not true and that his intelligence will fade soon. He notices erratic behavior from Algernon, and the rest of teh book is about solidifying his conclusions about human behavior and making sure that his legacy is impactful for people like him.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The book is a work of art in terms of narrative quality and in providing a perspective about the humanity in everyone.</p>
