# Fear.

Dire, dire, dire, dire

Crazy spikes in your comfy chair, lightning hits you that's only fair

Enemies in your workspace darling stabbers in your bedspace

Multitude hands poking me in my dreams

Edge of a cliff, and into the fire

I confess, as I undress, that this is why I surrender

Ten times a day, wicked paralysis in the small tests

I fear, disappear and pretend to persevere

At the dead of cowardly night I awaken

A fearless pretence, a stress relieving satire

Bravery soars through my veins, a momentary glimpse at the better me

I sit up in the dark and plot my schemes

Mischief, mayham and it all seems neat

I retire with optimism, I collapse in a meadow

Wake up in the morning, and the bus driver looks mad

Back to crazy town, I wear my fear like a thorny crown

Salute to the master, my paint is on his canvas

And he grips my hand tight, as he paints my future
